# Text & Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
Public Opinion on Twitter about the US airlines in 2015

## Aim

***Sentiment Analysis*** is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows us to determine algorithmically whether a statement or document is “positive” or “negative”.

Sentiment analysis is a technology of increasing importance in the modern society as it allows individuals and organizations to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media content. As the airline industry become increasingly competitive, airline companies are always trying their best to satisfy customer experience. Through sentiment analysis, these companies can obtain information on customers’ overall satisfaction and adopt business strategies to address aspects with low satisfaction.

The purpose of this project is to compute the sentiment of text information - in our case, tweets posted in 2015 regarding US airlines - and answer the research question: ***“What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the US airlines in 2015?”*** The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the people’s opinions on US airlines.
